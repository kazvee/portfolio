# üë©‚Äçüíª Portfolio

This is the repo for my portfolio website, which you can visit ‚ú®[HERE](https://kazvee.heliohost.us/)‚ú® 

## Purpose

I built this for some hands-on learning about what Next.js 14 can offer as a full-stack React framework.  
It's currently been deployed as a static site, but I plan to build out a backend solution using the [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) method, since it's currently the recommended approach for new applications.

I've written the project in TypeScript in order to re-familiarize myself with static typing in JavaScript since I haven't used TS in a while.

I'm enjoying Tailwind's utility-first approach so far. I especially like that I don't need to think of my own CSS class names! üòÉ
