            <p>
              This site uses the hCaptcha security service (hereinafter
              &quot;hCaptcha&quot;). This service is provided by Intuition
              Machines, Inc., a Delaware US Corporation (&quot;IMI&quot;).
              hCaptcha is used to check whether user actions (such as submitting
              a contact form) meet security requirements. To do this, hCaptcha
              analyzes the behavior of the website visitor based on various
              characteristics. This analysis starts automatically as soon as the
              visitor enters a part of the website with hCaptcha enabled. For
              the analysis, hCaptcha evaluates various information (e.g. IP
              address, how long the visitor has been on the website, or mouse
              movements made by the user). The data collected during the
              analysis will be forwarded to IMI. hCaptcha analysis in the
              &quot;invisible mode&quot; may take place completely in the
              background. Website visitors are not advised that such an analysis
              is taking place if they are not shown a challenge. Data processing
              is based on Art. 6(1)(b) of the GDPR: the processing of personal
              data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the
              website visitor is party (for example, the website terms) or in
              order to take steps at the request of the website visitor prior to
              entering into a contract. This site needs to ensure that it is
              interacting with a human, not a bot, and that activities performed
              by the user are not related to fraud or abuse. In addition,
              processing may also be based on Art. 6(1)(f) of the GDPR: this
              site has a legitimate interest in protecting against abusive
              automated crawling, spam, and other forms of abuse that can harm
              the site or other visitors. IMI acts as a &quot;data
              processor&quot; acting on behalf of its customers as defined under
              the GDPR, and a &quot;service provider&quot; for the purposes of
              the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). For more information
